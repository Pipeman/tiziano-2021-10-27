## How to run the app

The app was built with Expo to make it easy to distribute it for testing purposes.
To run it, other than the usual suspects, you need to have the [`expo-cli`](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/) installed.
Once you had that sorted you can run the following
```
$ cd tiziano-2021-10-27
$ expo install
$ expo start
```
At this point you can run it on an emulator (if you use MacOS you could run it on an iPhone emulator too), or run it on your Android device downloading the [Expo GO app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent), and then scan the QR code you can find either on the console or on the browser page that should have opened up.
